# Build-an-AI-ML-Tennis-Analysis-system-with-YOLO-PyTorch-and-Key-Point-Extraction
 use machine learning, computer vision and deep learning to create a tennis analysis system. This project utilizes YOlO a state of the art object detector to detect the players and the tennis balls. It also utilizes trackers to track those object across frames. We also write our own CNN to detect court key points.
